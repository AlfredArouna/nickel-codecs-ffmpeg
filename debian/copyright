copy of the unpacked ffmpeg-mt/LICENSE:

 # Most files in FFmpeg are under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1
 # or later (LGPL v2.1+). Read the file COPYING.LGPL for details. Some other files
 # have a MIT/X11/BSD-style license. In combination the LGPL v2.1+ applies to
 # FFmpeg.
 # 
 # Some optional parts of FFmpeg are licensed under the GNU General Public License
 # version 2 or later (GPL v2+). See the file COPYING.GPL for details. None of
 # these parts are used by default, you have to explicitly pass --enable-gpl to
 # configure to activate them. In this case, FFmpeg's license changes to GPL v2+.
 # 
 # Specifically, the GPL parts of FFmpeg are
 # 
 # - libpostproc
 # - some x86 optimizations in libswscale
 # - optional x86 optimizations in the files
 #   libavcodec/x86/h264_deblock_sse2.asm
 #   libavcodec/x86/h264_idct_sse2.asm
 #   libavcodec/x86/idct_mmx.c
 # - the AC-3 decoder in libavcodec/ac3dec.c
 # - the X11 grabber in libavdevice/x11grab.c
 # 
 # Some external libraries, e.g. libx264, are under GPL and can be used in
 # conjunction with FFmpeg. They require --enable-gpl to be passed to configure
 # as well.
 # 
 # The nonfree external libraries libamrnb, libamrwb and libfaac can be hooked up
 # in FFmpeg. You need to pass --enable-nonfree to configure to enable them. Employ
 # this option with care as FFmpeg then becomes nonfree and unredistributable.
 # Note that libfaac claims to be LGPL, but is not.
 # 
 # There are a handful of files under other licensing terms, namely:
 # 
 # * The files libavcodec/jfdctfst.c, libavcodec/jfdctint.c, libavcodec/jrevdct.c
 #   are taken from libjpeg, see the top of the files for licensing details.

The code actually built (see src/ffmpeg.gyp) is LGPL v2.1+ with the following
